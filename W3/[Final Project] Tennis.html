        A brief history of tennis
    </em>
</h3>
<p>
    In 1873, Londoner Major Walter Wingfield invented a game called he called
    Sphairistik√® (Greek for "playing ball"). Played on an hourglass-shaped
    court, Wingfield's game created a sensation in Europe, the United States,
    and even China, and is the source from which tennis as we know it today
    eventually evolved.
